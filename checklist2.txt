Week 2

There is some design documentation on the Wiki: Concern

You need to get to a much more detailed level right now.

What EXACTLY happens if Fred adds a class to his diagram, and Wilma is working
with him? How is her CollabViolet going to know? 

What EXACTLY is Fred's instance of CollabViolet sending to the server? 

What EXACTLY is Wilma's instance of CollabViolet querying the server, and 
what response is she getting? 

And how are you going to build that server? Put that in your Wiki! I see from
Bing's report that you have some problem. Email me and I can give you server
instructions.

Each team member has made at least one commit: No

I see commits from MarcoLiang, w851401530, and maraudershields. It's not so 
professional to use logins such as w851401530 and maraudershields. Pretty soon, 
you'll want to advertise your achievements to employers, and they won't be 
impressed with w851401530 and maraudershields. It's too late to fix it now, 
so email me to say who is who. And what's the deal with the fourth team mate?

Code builds on the command line, including javadoc and CheckStyle: No.

I got a compile time error when running ant.

Each issue doable in â‰¤ 3 days and has a single person assigned to it: No

"Write Server&Client code" clearly isn't

Each team member has closed at least one issue, with # in report: No

Only "maraudershields"

Each team member submitted their individual report: No

No report from Christopher
