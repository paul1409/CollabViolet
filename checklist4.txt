Design documentation lists all planned classes: Maybe

You need:
UML class diagram
Sequence diagram of what happens when something is sent to the server
Sequence diagram of what happens when client asks server for update
Text description of what exactly is sent to the server, and what the server sends back

There are sufficient issues to keep each team member busy: Ok

You should close #1, #6 as not useful and get "maraudershields" to get a move on #8

The project builds and does something significant: No

Typing 

ant

yields compilation failure. 

Need build directions for the server. Where is the code for it???
No status page, no test instructions


Every team member has multiple commits throughout the week: Yes

Very nice, keep it up!

Individual reports: Ok
