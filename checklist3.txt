Week 3

Functional specification (what the project will do) is complete: Ok

When user A edits the diagram and user B sees the change, will they see who made it?

There is some design documentation (key classes, mechanisms, protocols): Ok

Work on that next week.

There are sufficient issues to keep each team member busy for week 4: Ok

Make sure each issue is assigned to exactly one person, not 0, not 2.

Each team member has closed at least two issues and has put the closed issue number(s) in their report: Ok

No report from Christopher--I am assuming he dropped out. Check with him one more time.

The project builds and does something useful. Put instructions for building and for trying out that useful feature on the wiki: No

Build instructions? What is it doing so far?
